# .dot-files

This is my one and only `dotfiles` repo. I definitely do NOT have a secret, way messier one somewhere else. That would be ridiculous.

_Commands used to create symbolic links or `sym links`_:

- `mv .<file-name> .dot-files/.<file-name>` to move the file into your dotfiles directory
- `ln -s .dot-files/<file-name> .<file-name>` to create the `sym link` in the home directory
- `cd .dot-files` â†’ commit & push!

> Voila! You now how a seemless dotfiles tracking system!
